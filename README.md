## Presentation
Both of project show us how to use jQuery and Angular 2 together.
Into jq-ng-fullcalendar, we create Javascript `class` and `method` into js file to instantiate our plugin, then use this `class` into our component.
Into ng-fullcalendar, we demonstrate how to work with Javascript plugin without creating Javascript class to instantiate our plugin but we do the work into Angular 2 `component`.
